# ClassEngage
Personal
-This project is the product of Saratoga Springs High School 2016 EDD class.
-The key contributors to this project are: Kevin Postlethwait, Paul Harrington, Jake Kerr, Nick Biasetti, and Lucas Beitzel

Purpose
-The purpose of this project is to create a website on a local Wi-fi network not connected to the internet which teachers can control to better control their classroom.

Plan
-To do this we are creating a web application which the students must connect to during class.  By doing this we hope to eliminate the distraction of the phone from the classroom.
-Through this application the teacher should be able to draw and update graphs and display different screens
-Each student should be able to give feedback in the form of up and down arrows to tell the teacher to go faster or slow down.

If anyone has any suggestions for making our project better, or how to accomplish certain tasks we will graciously accept.
